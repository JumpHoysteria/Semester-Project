Biomedical electronics and wearable electronics rely heavily on highly stretchable strain sensors. In this work, we present a protocol, to electrolessly coat polurethane with gold to fabricate highly stretchable fibers that can exhibit an almost linear strain-resistance-relationship over the physiological range of 20\% strain. By reduction of gold exclusively in the fiber space through the usage of Ascorbic Acid, we set ground for a new species of conducting, strain sensing and potentially biocompatible fibers, which were not described in literature before.

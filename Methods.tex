y combining the gold dissolved in ethanol (EtOH), we were able to. Gold salt allows for solubility in solvent and there solvent and  being soluble in ethanol (EtOH) and a formidable oxidizing agent. A more 
Due to this projects target of coating only the surface and seeding only the volume of the fiber with gold while minimizing the part that does not wasting of gold , gold in salt form was chosen as the oxidation agent.

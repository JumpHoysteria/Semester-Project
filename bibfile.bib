abstract = "Compared to other basic mechanical properties of rocks, Poisson's ratio is an elastic constant of which the significance is generally underrated. Yet, in rock mechanics, there is a considerable number of diverse areas which require a prior knowledge or estimation of the value of Poisson's ratio. This paper examines the values and applications of Poisson's ratio in rock mechanics. Following an historical account of the initial controversy, whether it was a material constant or not, the effects of Poisson's ratio in the elastic deformation of materials, intact rocks, and rock masses are briefly reviewed. Also, the reported values of Poisson's ratio for some elements, materials, and minerals are compiled while typical ranges of values are presented for some rocks and granular soils. Finally, Poisson's ratio classifications are recommended for isotropic intact rocks."

In principle{,} such dispersions can be obtained by reduction of metal ions{,} in uncomplexed or complexed state{,} with suitable reducing agents and appropriate additives. The effect of the redox potential in a given oxidation/reduction system on the nature of the final particles is discussed in some detail. In another approach monodispersed particles of metal compounds are prepared first and then reduced to pure metals either in a liquid or a gaseous medium. In doing so{,} one can produce powders of a given morphology by selecting the precursor particles of the desired shape. A special case is represented by coated particles{,} consisting of cores and shells of different chemical composition. Depending on the materials{,} it is possible to reduce either one or both components by appropriate chemical reactions."}

\myworries{TODO: INTRODUCTION!}

Advances in Biomedical Applications have great value... Innovate medicine and allow better therapy, faster diagnostic and more authentic implants. Biosensors have reached to measure biological and chemical sensors. Mechanical modalities underepresented. With mechanobiology we have field, where influence is shown. Stem Cells, Cancerous Cells, Tissue adapt and form according to mechanical influence. High-energy tissue (tendon/ligaments) largely black box, many things still open. We need strain sensing. Current methods have drawbacks. Our stuff, best stuff. 

There's a need for yadayada.
